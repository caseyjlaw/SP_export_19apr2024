Recommendations for the format and storage locations for document
related to the development phase of the DSA-2000 are presented. A
distinction is made between fully self-contained documents that are also
of wide interest outside the project (*memos*), and documents that
contain critical project information that needs to be preserved and
updated as necessary (*project documents*). Project documents are
divided according to importance with *controlled documents* containing
critical project-wide information, and *uncontrolled documents* that are
more narrowly scoped. Repositories are identified for these various
types of documents.

# Introduction

We describe the document classification and storage schemes for the
development phase of DSA-2000. The aims are to make it easy to find
documents, to be able to sort them according to different criteria, to
encapsulate important information in a formalized way, and to make it as
easy as possible to contribute. For the construction phase of DSA-2000
stricter control of documentation may be required and at that point a
decision may be made on how much of the development documentation should
be included.

# Document types

A general classification for documents is their public availability. In
some cases, information to be easily available to the wider community,
while in others it is preferable to have easier access for project
members, or to restrict information that is confidential or proprietary.
The first group of documents will be classified as memos, and the second
as project documents.

## Memos

A DSA-2000 Memo Series will be maintained by the Caltech Library System
(CLS). Memos are considered to be essentially self-contained in the
sense that a publication is. They can be on any area of DSA-2000 that is
of general interest within and outside the DSA-2000 project. Memos will
be numbered consecutively on receipt. They will be given a DOI by CLS,
and for this reason are considered immutable. Errors, or new versions
can be submitted as Errata, or new numbered memos.

Memos will not be subject to any formal review or editing process, but
may be checked for proprietary or sensitive information. Templates will
be supplied in Word or Overleaf formats.

The final document format will be portable document format (PDF). At
some point, there may be more detailed guidelines if necessary. A member
of the project will be assigned to submitting documents to the CLS.

A link will be provided in SharePoint to the Memo Series once it goes
live.

## Project Documents

Some documents will encapsulate information that is critical for
multiple parts of the project, and that information should not be
changed without the agreement of all parties with vested interests. Such
documents are designated as being controlled and must be signed off by
the appropriate managers. Formal controlled and uncontrolled documents
will be consecutively numbered.

### Index and numbering

An index of documents is maintained in the OVRO: Projects SharePoint
subsite under DSA-2000 \> DSA-2000 Documents \> Project \> Development
WBS, as an Excel workbook ([[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2)).
Anyone can claim a document number by entering the next available number
and bookmarking it with their name in the Author(s) field. Once the
details are known the remaining fields can be filled in. When the
document is ready for distribution, it should be saved as a PDF and
uploaded to the SharePoint folder [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9).

Different versions of a given document must have a file name that
differs in the version number only. The filter and sort buttons on the
Excel index make it easy to show all versions of a given document to be
shown on consecutive lines.

### Format

A Word template is provided for convenience: [DSA-2000 Document template
v1.dotm](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20Document%20template%20v1.dotm?d=w674fb633850e46ad91165b184f01900e&csf=1&web=1&e=4UShmP).
This has a macro to set up some of the details, so *it cannot be used
directly in SharePoint*. It can be downloaded into your Custom Office
Templates folder, typically: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Custom Office
Templates. You can check in your settings by going to File -\> Options
-\> Advanced. Then scroll down to the General section and click on the
File Locations\... button.

The word format is a guide only and is not necessarily appropriate for
all documents. Drawing sets can be collections of pages of 2D
representations of CAD models, and schematics and PCB layouts can
similarly be collections of graphics pages (preferably with a cover
page, as is the custom with drawing sets).

While consistent formatting is very helpful for being able to find
information quickly, it should not be an impediment to submitting
documents.

### Controlled documents

This type of document may undergo many iterations before it being
approved. The associated version numbers for the drafts will have a
two-digit decimal part in the range 01---99 (e.g., v1.12) and signed-off
versions will have only an integer part (e.g., v2.00). The first signed
version will be v1.00, so initial drafts will be v0.01, v0.02, ....

Documents that must be controlled will be determined by Project
Management, but the general rule is that any document containing
information required by other parts of the project should be controlled.
This includes, but is not limited to, changes to

-   Specifications;

-   Cost;

-   Timeline;

-   Interfaces between parts of the system under different responsible
    project members;

-   User interfaces.

These documents will be important for ensuring that different parts of
the project will mesh well together, as well as removing uncertainties
about critical decisions.

It is possible that some features can be added to documents to allow
programmatic extraction of information. A particular case is a tag for
decisions that can be extracted into a decision register.

Controlled documents are stored in the [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)
and indexed in the [[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2).

### Uncontrolled documents

Other documents can be included in the Document Repository to capture
important information about various aspects of the project. Examples of
these are test reports, design documents, drawings, and so forth.
Documents in this category are important for ensuring availability of
information for further development, production, maintenance, and
tracking. They can cover all aspects, including engineering, management,
operations, and logistics.

Unontrolled documents are stored in the [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)
and indexed in the [[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2).

### Other documents

All documents germane to the project should be kept in a common area
that is accessible to everyone. Maintaining all the information this way
allows the easiest way of sharing information, and keeping a record of
designs and decision, as well as ensuring availability when people leave
the project. There are no restrictions on the types of documents that
can be stored. CAD files for mechanical, schematic capture, PCB layout,
and are all important, as are EM simulation models. Other formats, such
as Excel workbooks, Mathcad worksheets, MATLAB files should be preserved
in SharePoint.

These more general files should be placed under the relevant WBS Level 2
(subsystem) folder hierarchy in SharePoint ([Projects - Development
WBS - All Documents
(sharepoint.com)](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDevelopment%20WBS&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)).
Subfolders should be created as necessary to organize the information in
a logical way.

# Discussion

There may be changes to the details presented here based on experience
following the guidelines. This will be recorded in a new version of this
document, as needed.

Other paradigms for maintaining critical Project information will be
deployed for specific types of development. For example, maintaining
code is a specialized task that has well-established procedures for
version control and issue tracking. Mechanical drawings will be
incorporated in an Autodesk Vault storage system, with a defined
part/drawing/file numbering system.
