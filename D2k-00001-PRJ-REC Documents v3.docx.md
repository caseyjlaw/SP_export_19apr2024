Abstract

Recommendations for the format and storage locations for document
related to the development phase of the DSA-2000 are presented. A
distinction is made between fully self-contained documents that are also
of wide interest outside the project (*memos*), and documents that
contain critical project information that needs to be preserved and
updated as necessary (*project documents*). Project documents are
divided according to importance with *controlled documents* containing
critical project-wide information, and *uncontrolled documents* that are
more narrowly scoped. Repositories are identified for these various
types of documents.

# Introduction

We describe the document classification and storage schemes for the
development phase of DSA-2000. The aims are to make it easy to find
documents, to be able to sort them according to different criteria, to
encapsulate important information in a formalized way, and to make it as
easy as possible to contribute. For the construction phase of DSA-2000
stricter control of documentation may be required and at that point a
decision may be made on how much of the development documentation should
be included.

# Document types

A general classification for documents is their public availability. In
some cases, information to be easily available to the wider community,
while in others it is preferable to have easier access for project
members, or to restrict information that is confidential or proprietary.
The first group of documents will be classified as memos, and the second
as project documents.

## Memos

A DSA-2000 Memo Series will be maintained by the Caltech Library System
(CLS). Memos are considered to be essentially self-contained in the
sense that a journal publication is, for example. They can be on any
area of DSA-2000 that is of general interest within and outside the
DSA-2000 project. Memos will be numbered consecutively on receipt. They
will be given a DOI by CLS, and for this reason are considered
immutable. Errors, or new versions can be submitted as Errata, or new
numbered memos.

Memos will not be subject to any formal review or editing process, but
may be checked for proprietary or sensitive information. Templates will
be supplied in Word or Overleaf formats.

The final document format will be portable document format (PDF). At
some point, there may be more detailed guidelines if necessary. A member
of the project will be assigned to submitting documents to the CLS.

A link will be provided in SharePoint to the Memo Series once it goes
live.

## Project Documents

Some documents will encapsulate information that is critical for
multiple parts of the project, and that information should not be
changed without the agreement of all stakeholders. Such documents are
designated as being controlled and must be signed off by the appropriate
managers. Formal controlled and uncontrolled documents will be
consecutively numbered in the same series.

### Index and numbering

An index of documents is maintained in the OVRO: Projects SharePoint
subsite under **DSA-2000** \> **DSA-2000 Documents** \> **Project** \>
**Development WBS**, as an Excel workbook ([[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2)).
Anyone can claim a document number by entering the next available number
and bookmarking it with their name in the Author(s) field, for example.
Once the details are known the remaining fields can be filled in. When
the document is ready for distribution, it should be saved as a PDF and
uploaded to the SharePoint folder [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9).

Different versions of a given document must have file names that differs
in the version number only. The filter and sort buttons on the Excel
index make it easy to show all versions of a given document to be shown
on consecutive lines.

### Format

A Word template is provided for convenience. It can be used directly by
selecting **DSA-2000 Document** from, the **+ New** âˆ¨ menu item in the
[[Document
Repository](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9).]{.underline}
This has a macro to set up some of the details of the document using
drop-down options and form fields. Alternatively, it can be downloaded
from the [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)
into your Custom Office Templates folder. Typically this is
C:\\Users\\*user*\\Documents\\Custom Office Templates, but you can find
it in your settings by going to **File** \> **Options** \> **Advanced**
and scrolling down to the **General** section to **File Locations**.

The Word format is a guide only and is not necessarily appropriate for
all documents. Drawing sets can be collections of pages of 2D
representations of CAD models, and schematics and PCB layouts can
similarly be collections of graphics pages (preferably with a cover
page, as is the custom with drawing sets).

While consistent formatting is very helpful for being able to find
information quickly, it should not be an impediment to submitting
documents.

### Controlled documents

This type of document may undergo many iterations before it being
approved. The associated version numbers for the drafts will have a
two-digit decimal part in the range 01---99 (e.g., v1.12) and signed-off
versions will have only an integer part (e.g., v2.00). The first signed
version will be v1.00, so initial drafts will be v0.01, v0.02, ....

Documents that must be controlled will be determined by Project
Management, but the general rule is that any document containing
information required by other parts of the project should be controlled.
This includes, but is not limited to, changes to

-   Specifications;

-   Cost;

-   Timeline;

-   Interfaces between parts of the system under different responsible
    project members;

-   User interfaces.

These documents will be important for ensuring that different parts of
the project will mesh well together, as well as removing uncertainties
about critical decisions.

It is possible that some features can be added to documents to allow
programmatic extraction of information. A particular case is a tag for
decisions that can be extracted into a decision register.

Controlled documents are stored in the [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)
and indexed in the [[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2).

### Uncontrolled documents

Other documents can be included in the Document Repository to capture
important information about various aspects of the project. Examples of
these are test reports, design documents, drawings, and so forth.
Documents in this category are important for ensuring availability of
information for further development, production, maintenance, and
tracking. They can cover all aspects, including engineering, management,
operations, and logistics.

Unontrolled documents are stored in the [[Document
Repository]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDocument%20Library&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)
and indexed in the [[DSA-2000 document
index.xlsx]{.underline}](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Project/Document%20Library/DSA-2000%20document%20index.xlsx?d=w9b932aaf4c8d450db7244d341698163e&csf=1&web=1&e=Cnd7B2).

### Other documents

All documents germane to the project should be kept in a common area
that is accessible to everyone. Maintaining all the information this way
allows easy sharing information, and acts as a record of designs and
decision, as well as ensuring availability when people leave the
project. There are no restrictions on the types of documents that can be
stored. CAD files for mechanical, schematic capture, PCB layout, and are
all important, as are EM simulation models. Other formats, such as Excel
workbooks, Mathcad worksheets, MATLAB files should be preserved in
SharePoint.

These more general files should be placed under the relevant WBS Level 2
(subsystem) folder hierarchy in SharePoint ([Projects - Development
WBS - All Documents
(sharepoint.com)](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/sites/ovro/projects/dsa2000documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fovro%2Fprojects%2Fdsa2000documents%2FProject%2FDevelopment%20WBS&viewid=8dcf5501%2Dba84%2D4e06%2Db1eb%2D7482aa303df9)).
Subfolders should be created as necessary to organize the information in
a logical way.

# Discussion

There may be changes to the details presented here based on experience
following the guidelines. This will be recorded in a new version of this
document, as needed.

Other paradigms for maintaining critical Project information will be
deployed for specific types of development. For example, maintaining
code is a specialized task that has well-established procedures for
version control and issue tracking. Mechanical drawings will be
incorporated in an Autodesk Vault storage system, with a defined
part/drawing/file numbering system.
